### Report:

I started this project by designing a simple website in Adobe XD.   
It is a rough design since i often catch myself changing it anyways, but I was also eager to start on the more technical side.   It was important to me to make sure that the backbone of my website is working as it should.  
I then installed wordpress on my hosted domain and created the api and post.   
For authentication i used the jwt plugin for wordpress which provides auth endpoints to the REST api.  

I built a basic html without any styling at first and started to add funcionality.  
I started with authentication and login and all the get request, creating, deleting and updating the posts came after that.  
I finished by conditionally showing/hiding element based on if user is logged in or logged out.

One thing that i found harder than i thought it would be was actually writing vanilla JS.   
After learning React and mostly using it for all my coding i forgot how tough it is to code plain JS.  
Because of this i felt like this assigment took a while longer than i have planned.  

I havent focused as much on design since i wanted for all the "backend" stuff to be working properly,   
and to be honest i much prefer the more technical coding than designing and stylizing.   
Even tho I think that design of the webpage could have been done better. Otherwise I am quite happy with the result.
